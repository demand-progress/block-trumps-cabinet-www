I just made this phone call:

    <script type="text/template" id="email-share-body">Hi - I just called the U.S. Senate to tell them to oppose Donald Trump’s terrible pick for Treasury Secretary, "foreclosure king" Steve Mnuchin.

Mnuchin spent his career getting rich at the expense of ordinary Americans. His foreclosure mill of a bank, OneWest, foreclosed on well over 36,000 homes nationwide – even kicking out a 90-year old woman over a payment error of 27 cents.

Phone calls from constituents are one of the most powerful ways to get senators to stand up against Trump's cabinet of Wall Street greed. Could you take a minute to call?
